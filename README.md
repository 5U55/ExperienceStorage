# Experience Storage Mod

Have you ever wanted to go on a risky mission, but you have a lot of EXP and you don't want to lose it? Instead of wasting that EXP on terrible enchanted books you can now store it in Bottles O' Enchanting. This mod introduces an Experience Storage Table, this is a block, that when clicked on with a an empty glass bottle grants the player a Bottle O' Enchanting, the table then takes away 7 experience points away from the player. Bottles O' Enchanting give the player on average 7 experience points when broken, but, can grant anywhere from 3-11 points, this means there is a risk that the player will potentially lose or gain some experience when they go to regain their experience from the bottles. The Experience Storage Table can be crafted with 2 gold ingots, 1 lapis-lazuli, an emerald block and 5 wooden planks, the layouts of these items in the crafting table can be found in the in game recipe book.Â
